# My NixOs config

I have no real experience in nixos, so this will be a for ever work in progress. My choices here may be bad choices and should never taken as good practices. Best case scenario is 'it works on my laptop'

## Structure

On my machines, /etc/nixos is a clone of this repo.

[configuration.nix](configuration.nix) is the first file read by nixos and (will) contain common system settings across my machines.

It expects a symlink **local** in **machines/**, targeting the real machine folder, containing

 * **hardware-configuration.nix** is generated by nix and should never be modified
 * **configuration.nix** contains specific system settings

machine's configuration.nix imports modules:

 * **common** is basic shell config that I want everywhere
 * **laptops** is everything I need to geek like gnome env, browser and vscode
 * **servers** is mostly ssh and k3s config
 * **work** is specific configs for my job
 * **games** is more or less steam

| machine     | status                    | [common] | [laptops] | [servers] | [work] | [games] |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------- | --------- | --------- | ------ | ------- |

| [beryllium] | my personal server        | ✅        | ❌         | ✅         | ❌      | ❌       |
| [boron]     | my work laptop (expected) | ✅        | ✅         | ❌         | ✅      | ❌       |
