# My NixOs config

I have no real experience in nixos, so this will be a for ever work in progress. My choices here may be bad choices and should never taken as good practices. Best case scenario is 'it works on my laptop'

## Structure

On my laptops, /etc/nixos is a clone of this repo.

[configuration.nix](configuration.nix) is the first file read by nixos and (will) contain common system settings across my machines.

It expects a symlink **local** in **machines/**, targeting the real machine

| machine                       | status    |                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| [hydrogen](machines/hydrogen) | soon dead | my old laptop, now used as backup or testing machine |
| [helium](machines/helium)     | in use    | my current work laptop                               |
| [lithium](machines/lithium)   | incoming  | my next personnal laptop                             |

In a machine folder:
 * **hardware-configuration.nix** is generated by nix and should never be modified
 * **configuration.nix** contains specific system settings
